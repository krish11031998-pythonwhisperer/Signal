If you haven't read my theory on a [GME Entertainment Spinoff,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/tbh9hz/gme_theory_update_gamestop_entertainment_llc/) you can here (though remember this is a long play and won't happen until the business is more mature with $1B in revenues, so say 12-24 months). The way to visualize this is basically eBay and PayPal (who were once part of the same company). The retail + tech was separated and unlocked tremendous shareholder value (you get shares in both). We know Ryan Cohen likes an idea of spin-offs from his [BBBY Letter to Shareholders](https://www.investreader.com/articles/bed-bath--beyond-shareholders-beware-as-ryan-cohen-takes-aim-at-the-company-1647114468), so I think this is a hint into his way of thinking/strategy in the longer run.\n\n&gt;Cohen’s letter to the Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond board says the turnaround of CEO Mark Tritton looks “better in a PowerPoint deck than it does in practice.” He wants the company to sell or **spin off Buybuy Baby, which he thinks will bring “several billion dollars”** based on $1.5 billion in revenue. The company had a market cap of $2.2 billion on March 9.\n\nBack to Kurt, who executed the GameStop and IMX agreement:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9892hxzuxjq81.png?width=1484&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=151afff3652eba8013d20f5132b66f7e230efecb\n\nKurt is a **blockchain superstar**\\- but he comes with a **very particular set of skills.**\n\nHe brings to GameStop something that no one has... yet.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h96f401dyjq81.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22140112900d12f2d7e7d4bcd1c2ba9484ba3d4d\n\nKurt has experience with **US Regulated Cryptocurrency and Blockchain technology**. He also was heavily involved in business deals with the largest foreign exchange brokerages globally, largest **cryptocurrency exchange** in Japan, bitcoin mining, **gaming platforms**, **NFT platforms** and **stable coins.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vr39xv7eyjq81.png?width=706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=044b02926f4caa4a691faf14a02640bfa31f8c96\n\nHe also comes from the institutional world (big money) and created a regulated dark pool cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nI wrote a theory describing how I believe GameStop is working to build an [ATS (Alternate Trading System) Exchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/t7ghsf/gamestop_loopring_tokenized_peer_to_peer_stock/) based on ComputerShare with the GameStop Wallet on Loopring Protocol.\n\nThe TLDR is ComputerShare holds custody of your real shares/stocks. Those shares are tokenized 1-1 and sent to your GameStop Wallet. You can then trade peer-to-peer with barely any fees, no broker commissions, no settlement issues (instant settlement), no exchange rebates, no PFOF, no manipulation.\n\nKurt also has experience already with crypto wallets (like the forthcoming GameStop Wallet, built using Loopring). Note that wallets, like the GameStop Wallet, are for retail use.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqghr39xzjq81.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c1f84f7d4bcabed288a5416b11c247067492169\n\nBUT big institutions and corporations, like Microsoft, won't keep assets in a Loopring or GameStop wallet. They need something else. They need a **Blockchain Bank.**\n\nEnter the missing link for institutional adoption (and the same relationships Kurt has worked with before to build some of the biggest crypto businesses in the world).\n\n# Silvergate Blockchain Bank\n\nIf GameStop is building an exchange then SilverGate is the missing piece in the middle that will connect all other crypto exchanges and allow for all kinds of institutional trading.\n\n[Note: this image is my illustration of GameStop Exchange in the eco-system only.](https://preview.redd.it/hfojmafs0kq81.png?width=1869&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df3d687f0e1c4b327d440c8a01962b11fd25440e)\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am merely proposing that an entity like Silvergate is an essential and critical part of GameStop Exchange. I have not found any definitive ties to suggest Silvergate is THE partner, however I do think they are the best fit.\n\n[SilverGate would provide an essential institutional component to the GameStop Marketplace](https://preview.redd.it/qfbvrq6xujq81.png?width=1992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0ff9280849f9cc4a9fd0df36cdb018fc536eda0)\n\n[SilverGate would allow someone to stake coins, currency or any other digital property in your GameStop Wallet and earn interest by offering that through the SEN Exchange network. In affect someone on Coinbase could borrow your BTC and pay you interest. ](https://preview.redd.it/z9ntreq8vjq81.png?width=906&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5611d1e1e0a5d5c0f89d1403b4d62433865c3a3)\n\nRight now prime-brokers and banks lend out your **CASH** and **STOCK** and make a **HUGE PROFIT**. In the future you can lend out your **CASH** and **STOCK** or **DIGITAL ASSETS** via GameStop Exchange and SilverGate to receive **PASSIVE INCOME** while it being 100% secure. This is truly democratizing finance.\n\nHere is a basic metaphor for how all these relationships work:\n\n**Gamestop** = Amazon / Storefront (Wallet, marketplace, retail stores)**Microsoft** = Gaming Studio Partner / Publisher**Silvergate** = Institutional Gateway to crypto financing, custody, etc for someone of Microsoft's size + Exchange network for mass market level on and off ramps**ComputerShare** = Transfer Agent for Direct Registered Shares traded between Retail on Loopring or between institutions through Silvergate (Institutional Desk, OTC, Block etc.)**Loopring** = L2 Protocol for everything to happen on at commoditized levels (every skin, game license, stock share, etc. an NFT)\n\nImagine a Game Studio who is seeking financing to develop a new game. You could stake your Bitcoin on GameStop Exchange and lock it in for 1 year at a certain rate. That Game Studio will convert that Bitcoin Loan into $USD cash to build their game. Crypto owners will be empowered with all new ways to generate income while Game Developers, especially small ones, can have access to financing. We can even imagine that early investors would receive coins which could later share in some of the transactions within a game. The possibilities are endless.\n\nOr, in a simple example, you can lock your bitcoin in the GameStop Exchange and someone will pay you VIA Silvergate to borrow it.\n\n[Gaming\\/Studios and Game Finance of the Future](https://preview.redd.it/tjb797m81kq81.png?width=1262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87a949e788491439270114d62f6501a508676f7f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m5x6h6yu8kq81.png?width=1480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54c09ce44c903cfaff09f5901eb5c3dd1ebd6a65\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c7z2nzux8kq81.png?width=1091&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=735c20fcf0c5b3d1a55dd61ecbb2b2eb6954ffee\n\nKurt Bierbower, all star blockchain executive, is head of GME Entertainment. He comes from the world of big finance. He has amazing credentials working building regulated crypto currency products including ATS (alternate trading systems), wallets, crypto financial products, and working with big institutions.\n\nThe GameStop Exchange will enable you to stake **CASH, STOCKS, DIGITAL ASSETS** and through a company like SilverGate receive passive income for lending of those assets. Vice versa you could take loans. These exchanges operating together will enable all kinds of new digital economies.\n\n[The original medium post by Loopring describing Gamestop's vision.

No doubt GameStop isn't advertising their strategy.](https://preview.redd.it/yd9u78ig9kq81.png?width=273&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=270494f79231c016886e803f5e0de64fd865831f)\n\nWith Silvergate you could stake your assets on GameStop and someone on Coinbase could borrow them, and vice versa, all paying you, the owner, some agreed rate of return. This is empowering!\n\nSo, tying it all together:\n\n**GameStop** (the exchange and platform) + **Loopring** (the protocol) + **ComputerShare** (custodian of securities on a blockchain ledger) + **Silvergate** (Institutional Gateway to crypto financing for BIG players, like Microsoft) + **Microsoft** (Game Studio/IP owner/ Publisher).\n\nThere is a real paradigm shift in gaming. You can read Microsofts latest letter [here](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/02/09/open-app-store-principles-activision-blizzard/) where they describe they're building an open platform that will allow developers, and their games, to have full control over the game economies/fees/financing they choose.\n\n&gt;Just as Windows has evolved to an open and broadly used platform, we see the future of gaming following a similar path. **Today 2.8 billion consumers worldwide, including more than 190 million Americans, play games, and we expect the global number will reach 4.5 billion by 2030** as new generations turn to gaming for entertainment, community, and a sense of achievement. Our vision is to enable gamers to **play any game on any device anywhere, including by streaming from the cloud**. App stores on the most relevant and popular everyday devices like mobile phones; PCs, including Windows PCs; and, in time, the cloud, are important to realizing this vision.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But **too much friction exists today between creators and gamers**; app store policies and practices on mobile devices restrict what and how creators can offer games and what and how gamers can play them. Our large investment to acquire Activision Blizzard further strengthens our resolve to remove this friction on behalf of creators and gamers alike. **We want to enable world-class content to reach every gamer more easily across every platform. We want to encourage more innovation and investment in content creation and fewer constraints on distribution. Put simply, the world needs open app markets,** and this requires open app stores. The principles we’re announcing today reflect our commitment to this goal.\n\nBlockchain Gaming is going to become a HUGE industry on an exponential growth curve. GameStop Exchange is your one stop shop for crypto-currencies, stablecoins, tokens and tokenized products (like securities, stocks, bonds), NFTs, game-fi economies. With GameStop Exchange you can trade your stock for BTC, stake that BTC via SilverGate and earn interest, and institutional investors can borrow your BTC or you can borrow from them (with collateralized BTC loans). You truly can BE YOUR OWN BANK.\n\nAlso I'm doing a twitter thing if you want to [follow me.](https://twitter.com/EndOfTheWake) As of writing I have a whole 20 followers, which is cool.\n\n# TLDR:\n\nYou **really** should read this whole piece.. but... for the goldfish.\n\nKurt Bierbower, head of GME Entertainment LLC, is a block-chain banking all star and is the visionary that will bring GameStop to mainstream adoption. One critical missing component is how different crypto exchanges can operate together (think Coinbase and GameStop) and how institutions like Microsoft or pension funds will participate in this eco-system. Microsoft, for example, won't have a GameStop wallet- they'll use someone like SilverGate (my best guess) for access to crypto financing.\n\nImagine your GameStop wallet holds your digital property including **CASH, NFTs, CRYPTO CURRENCY**, **STOCKS**... Silvergate would allow other participants to borrow your assets and pay you interest. Brokers and banks make **HUGE PROFITS** loaning out your stocks and money... Very soon you can do this yourself.\n\nThe ecosystem of partnerships is growing and we now have the following:\n\n**GameStop** (the exchange and platform) + **Loopring** (the protocol) + **ComputerShare** (custodian of securities on a blockchain ledger) + **Silvergate** (Institutional Gateway to crypto financing for BIG players, like Microsoft) + **Microsoft** (Game Studio/IP owner/ Publisher)\n\n...and sub partners like Pinata for IPFS storage.\n\nAt last.... **BEHOLD**\n\n&amp;#x200B;","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Superstonk","subreddit_id":"t5_43zwn1","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r/Superstonk","title":"GME Exchange: Change The Game.

We’ve already seen significant organic growth in NFT marketplaces, browser wallet support, and related projects.\n\n**Hedera Apps**\n\nHedera is home to hundreds of projects in the web3 space — here’s a [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/bmgentile/status/1404570788951326724) outlining a few of those larger applications. Additionally, full case studies can be found [here](https://www.hedera.com/users).\n\nAs HBAR Foundation ecosystem grants ramp up, we’ll begin to see massive development of retail-focused applications coming to Hedera, such as these ones available today:\n\n* NFT marketplaces like [Zuse](https://zuse.market/), [HashAxis](https://hashaxis.com/), and [Turtlemoon](https://launch.turtlemoon.io/).\n* Wallets with transaction signing like [HashPack](https://www.hashpack.app/) and [Venly](https://www.venly.io/)\n* Network bridges like [HashPort](https://www.hashport.network/)\n* Staking delegation apps like [StaderLabs](https://hedera.staderlabs.com/)\n\nAll of which have been built organically by the Hedera developer community.\n\n**Smart Contract Hackathon | Now - May 16th | $500k+ in prizes**\n\nHedera is hosting a [Solidity smart contract hackathon](https://hedera22.devpost.com/) through May 16th with over $500k in prizes to be earned for building DeFi, DAO, NFT, and Payment focused applications.\n\n**Upcoming Milestones**\n\nThe product and ecosystem roadmap for Hedera can be found at [https://hedera.com/roadmap](https://hedera.com/roadmap).\n\nA few things we’re especially excited about:\n\n* Community-run network nodes\n* Staking of HBAR on Hedera ([HIP-406](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-improvement-proposal/blob/master/HIP/hip-406.md))\n* Developer tooling (web3.js and ethers.js support)\n\n**Social**\n\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hedera?lang=en), [Discord (Developers Only)](https://hedera.com/discord), [Subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/hedera)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Myths to Dispel\n\n* **Myth #1: Hashgraph consensus and Hedera’s services are proprietary**\n   * Hedera’s network services, officially supported SDKs, and every developer tool is open source under an Apache 2.0 license. Hashgraph consensus [will be open source this year](https://cointelegraph.com/news/hedera-governing-council-to-buy-hashgraph-ip-and-open-source-projects-code) under an Apache 2.0 license. You can find the Hedera project’s GitHub here: [https://github.com/hashgraph/](https://github.com/hashgraph/)\n* **Myth #2: Developers building dapps on Hedera can’t contribute to the project**\n   * [Hedera Improvement Proposals (HIPs)](https://hips.hedera.com/) include core protocol changes, as well as changes to the applications, frameworks, and protocols built on top of the Hedera public network and used by the community.The [goal of HIPs](https://hips.hedera.com/) is to have a place for everyone to propose new features, collect community thoughts and input on a particular issue, document all subject matters in one place, and provide a status on their implementation. You can view all of the HIPs and contribute here: [https://hips.hedera.com/all.html](https://hips.hedera.com/all.html)\n* **Myth #3: Hedera is a private, permissioned network for Enterprises**\n   * The Hedera network is a public network infrastructure for everyone to anonymously create accounts and build decentralized applications on, without telling anyone who they are or performing KYC/AML.\n   * The Hedera network today is operated by members of the [governing council](http://hedera.com/council) — each of the 26 members independently operates and maintains an individual node in their own data center or public cloud, ensuring full decentralization of consensus. This year, Hedera is allowing for community nodes — any member of the Hedera community can independently operate a node and earn [$HBAR](http://hedera.com/hbar). And in the future, the entire network will be permissionless. Read the “path to permissionless” whitepaper [here](https://hedera.com/hh-decentralization-of-consensus.pdf).\n* **Myth #4: Hedera doesn't have performant smart contracts**\n   * Hedera’s smart contracts 2.0 is an implementation of the Besu EVM (Solidity) that has been optimized for the Hedera network and hashgraph consensus. Solidity-based smart contracts on Hedera off the following benefits:\n      * No congestion fees for gas  / all txn fees are fixed ([www.hedera.com/fees](http://www.hedera.com/fees))\n      * 15 million gas / second\n      * 300+ txns / second\n      * Integration with the native Token Service on Hedera mapped to ERC-20, 721, 1155 standards, 10k txns per second, and $0.0001 txn fees.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Getting started with Hedera: A guide for devs and degens\n\n**Developer Quickstart**\n\nThe easiest way as a developer to get started building on Hedera is by checking out the official Hedera documentation at [https://docs.hedera.com/](https://docs.hedera.com/) and getting a testnet account from [https://portal.hedera.com](https://portal.hedera.com/) — we have [officially-supported SDKs](https://docs.hedera.com/guides/docs/sdks) available in Java, Javascript, and Go.\n\n* [Set up your environment](https://docs.hedera.com/guides/getting-started/environment-set-up)\n* Try [examples](https://docs.hedera.com/guides/getting-started/try-examples), [tutorials](https://docs.hedera.com/guides/resources/tutorials), and [demo applications](https://docs.hedera.com/guides/resources/demo-applications)\n* [Join the developer community on Discord](https://hedera.com/discord)\n* [Explore transaction history (Dragon Glass)](https://app.dragonglass.me/hedera/home)\n\n**Degen Quickstart**\n\nAs a self-proclaimed degenerate holding $HBAR, you have opportunities to use that $HBAR for things like staking, minting, buying, and selling NFTs, and participating in DeFi applications.\n\n1. Install the [HashPack](https://www.hashpack.app/post/how-to-create-your-first-account-with-hashpack) browser wallet extension on Chrome: [https://www.hashpack.app/post/how-to-create-your-first-account-with-hashpack](https://www.hashpack.app/post/how-to-create-your-first-account-with-hashpack)\n2.

Last week, a youtuber called 'Coffeezilla' released a 40 minute scathing video where he attacked the project and it's CEO's, accusing them of fraud. Many of these allegations were hard to stand against with some of evidence presented. At the time, the subreddit went into peak copium, and more or less labelled the video and the youtuber as 'FUD'. Still, despite allegations of fraud, no official response to the allegations was given by the development team.\n\nHowever, once again, Coffeezilla has reared his head. In response to the backlash (general rage and even threats to sue) by the Safemoon community and the lack of the developer response, Coffeezilla posted another video titled \"Safemoon Denied Everything, So I Dug Deeper\". \n\nTo sum up the most recent video, Coffeezilla has concrete evidence that money was miused and stolen. To make a long story short, big safemoon wallets that appear to be controlled by Karony, one of the main project guys, was used for personal purchases in NFT/memecoins instead of returned to the liquidity. Essentially, this means that **several safemoon wallets owned by important people in the company were used for personal reasons and not for the 'project' or 'investment' that people gave them money for**.\n\nLast week's 'FUD' was bad enough. However, with this massive reveal, with little room for reasonable deniability, is Safemoon done? Is this yet another big project by Big FudZilla? Will people keep buying anyway? Is it all a cult? Has the sub been 'infiltrated' by downers who reek havoc on joy-havers?\n\nThis post will include multiple threads.\n\n[Not watching it. Please whomever is reading this, we passed this stage. We don’t care about it anymore. Keep giving Coffeezila clout and he will never stop. He is only posting about SFM because of the views. Go read his disclaimers “this is my opinion &amp; not a fact” Even he doesn’t believe nor wants to stand by what he says. Edit: Downvoted because some minions would rather see their own investment fall down harder than help prop it up by moving on.

Questions maybe need to get answered but we only have coffees side which has been proven multiple times that he gets information wrong and will twist and edit and omit anything to make it seem like he is right. Until we have actual proof and not just coffee screaming random wallets are John's, this came out of the bitmart hotwallet, which all buys and transfers coming out of bitmart are shown from the hotwallet, and stuff that is not proven as fact, then we should again give it the 48 hour treatment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SafeMoon/comments/uehk64/i_dont_care_what_john_does_with_his_moneybut/i6ndq2r/)\n\n[I'm not defending anything here and I haven't also watched the video yet.
